##### Abstract

**Purpose:** The aim of this research was to discuss the
use of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning
(ML), and big data analytics as fundamental pillars
of strategic supply chain management, for better
decision-making, more precise forecasting, and
higher supply chain agility.

**Methodology:** The paper reviewed existing
literature and industry reports to get an in-depth
insight into the modern supply chain planning
environment, the problems that it faces, and the
efficiency of traditional techniques. It then analyzed
the opportunities of utilization of AI, ML and big
data analytics as well as the certain technologies or
techniques that could be utilized, such as the
predictive/prescriptive analytics, digital twins and
blockchain.

**Findings**: The study concluded that the traditional
supply chain planning processes are becoming more
and more out of style and inefficient, taking into
account the business environment that are constantly
changing, global supply chains, and technological
advancements. It emphasized the risks to long-term
performance associated to relying too much on the
past practices and a call for action for progressive
modernization of supply chain planning
mechanisms.

**Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and
Policy:** The report pointed to innovative ways such
as AI, ML, and big data analytics for the integration
into the supply chain operations for increasing the
productivity, resilience and competitiveness.
Moreover, it promoted the increase of budgeting on
the talent side in order to obtain an appropriate use
of technology and to explore new paths in the
market.
